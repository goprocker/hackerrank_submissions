## Problem

Adam decides to be generous and do some charity. Starting today, from day 1 until day n, he gives i2 coins to charity on day ‘i’ (1 <= i <= n).

Return the total coins he would give to charity.

 **Input Format** 

Input consists of one integer

 **Constraints** 

NA

 **Output Format** 

Output consists of one integer

 **Sample Input 0** 

```
2

```

 **Sample Output 0** 

```
5

```

 **Explanation 0** 

- There are 2 days.
- On the first day, he will give 1^2 = 1 coin.
- On the second day, he will give 2^2 = 4.
- Total no.of coins = 1 + 4 = 5

 **Sample Input 1** 

```
5

```

 **Sample Output 1** 

```
55

```

 **Explanation 1** 

- There are 5 days.
- On the first day, he will give 1^1 = 1 coin.
- On the second day, he will give 2^2 = 4 coins and therefore 9, 16 and 25 respectively on 3rd, 4th, 5th day.
- Total no of coins = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 = 55
