# Strings - Character Count 1

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Mario wants to determine whether any letter in a given word is repeated more than three times. If any letter appears more than three times, Mario should discard the word. Write a program that takes a single word as input and outputs the highest number of times any letter appears within that word. If this count exceeds three, Mario can discard the word.

 **Input Format** 

A single string value consisting of lowercase alphabets (a-z).

 **Constraints** 

The input string will only contain lowercase alphabets: str = {a-z}.

 **Output Format** 

A positive integer representing the highest number of times any letter appears in the input word.

 **Sample Input 0** 

```
trumpet

```

 **Sample Output 0** 

```
2

```

 **Explanation 0** 

- The word "trumpet" has the letter 't' repeated 2 times, and all other letters appear only once.
- The highest number of repeating letters is 2.

 **Sample Input 1** 

```
reiterate

```

 **Sample Output 1** 

```
3

```

 **Explanation 1** 

- The word "reiterate" has the letter 'e' repeated 3 times, and other letters appear once or twice.
- The highest number of repeating letters is 3.

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        if (scanner.hasNext()) {
            String word = scanner.next();
            int[] charCount = new int[26];
            int maxFrequency = 0;

            for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
                char c = word.charAt(i);
                int index = c - 'a';
                charCount[index]++;
                if (charCount[index] > maxFrequency) {
                    maxFrequency = charCount[index];
                }
            }

            System.out.println(maxFrequency);
        }
        scanner.close();
    }
}

```
