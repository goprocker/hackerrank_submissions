# Decision Making - Event Scheduling for Leap Year Celebrations

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

In a city, special events are scheduled every leap year to celebrate community milestones. Event organizers need a program that can help them identify whether a given year is a leap year, so they can schedule their events accordingly. If the year is a leap year, the program should notify the organizers to "Schedule Event"; otherwise, it should inform them "No Event This Year."

Write a program to determine if a given year is a leap year. If it is, print "Schedule Event"; otherwise, print "No Event This Year."

A year is considered a leap year if:

- It is divisible by 4,
- If it is a century year (i.e., divisible by 100), it must also be divisible by 400.

 **Input Format** 

A single integer representing the year.

 **Constraints** 

NA

 **Output Format** 

- Output "Schedule Event" if the year is a leap year.
- Output "No Event This Year" if it is not a leap year.

 **Sample Input 0** 

```
2024

```

 **Sample Output 0** 

```
Schedule Event

```

 **Explanation 0** 

The year 2024 is divisible by 4 and not a century year, so it is a leap year.

 **Sample Input 1** 

```
2023

```

 **Sample Output 1** 

```
No Event This Year

```

 **Explanation 1** 

The year 2023 is not divisible by 4, so it is not a leap year.

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int year = scanner.nextInt();

        if ((year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0)) {
            System.out.println("Schedule Event");
        } else {
            System.out.println("No Event This Year");
        }
        
        scanner.close();
    }
}

```
