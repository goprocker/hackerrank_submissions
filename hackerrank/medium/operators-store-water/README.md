![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

You live in a city that is facing a water crisis. The timings when water is supply day are fixed. You have several water tankers that are cylindrical in shape, an know the radius R and height of the tanker. Your task is to find and return integer value representing the amount (in litres) of water you will be able to a particular day.

 **Note** 

- Use π = 3.14
- Round of the values to the nearest integer

 **Input Format** 

- An integer value R representing the radius of the container
- An integer value H representing the height of the container.

 **Constraints** 

NA

 **Output Format** 

Return an integer value representing the amount in litres of water you will be able to store on a particular day.

 **Sample Input 0** 

```
5
10

```

 **Sample Output 0** 

```
785

```

 **Explanation 0** 

Here, the given values are R = 5 and H = 10. The amount of water that can be stored on this day is 3.14 *5* 5*10=785. Therefore, 785 is returned as the output.

 **Sample Input 1** 

```
7
9

```

 **Sample Output 1** 

```
1385

```

 **Explanation 1** 

Here, the given values are R = 7 and H = 9. The amount of water that can be stored on this day is 3.14 *7* 7*9=1384.7, which can be rounded up to the value 1385. Therefore, 1385 is returned as the output.

        int r = scanner.nextInt();
        int h = scanner.nextInt();
        
        double litre = (3.14 * r * r * h);
        
        long D = Math.round(litre);
        
        System.out.println(D);
        scanner.close();
    }
}

```
