# Array 2D - Irene's Audience Arrangement Checker

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Irene, one of the event organizers, has arranged the audience in a matrix format where boys are represented by 1s and girls by 0s. To win a prize, she must ensure that all girls (0s) are positioned below the main diagonal of the matrix. If she successfully arranges the audience according to this condition, she will be rewarded; otherwise, she will not.

Your task is to help the judges determine if Irene's arrangement is valid by checking if the matrix is an upper triangular matrix.

 **Problem Statement** 

Write a program that checks whether a given matrix is an upper triangular matrix. A matrix is considered upper triangular if all the elements below the main diagonal are zero.

 **Input Format** 

- The first line contains an integer n, representing the number of rows and columns of the square matrix.
- The next n lines contain space-separated integers representing the matrix.

 **Constraints** 

The matrix is a square matrix (i.e., the number of rows equals the number of columns).

 **Output Format** 

Print "Upper triangular matrix" if the condition is satisfied; otherwise, print "Not an Upper triangular matrix"

 **Sample Input 0** 

```
3
1 2 3
0 1 2
0 0 1

```

 **Sample Output 0** 

```
Upper triangular matrix

```

 **Explanation 0** 

In this input, all elements below the diagonal are 0, hence it is an upper triangular matrix.

 **Sample Input 1** 

```
3
0 0 0
0 8 0
4 9 7

```

 **Sample Output 1** 

```
Not an Upper triangular matrix

```

 **Explanation 1** 

In this input, the element 4 below the diagonal is not 0, hence it is not an upper triangular matrix.

        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                a[i][j] = sc.nextInt();
            }
        }
        
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                // i > j represents elements below the main diagonal
                if(i > j && a[i][j] != 0) {
                    System.out.println("Not an Upper triangular matrix");
                    return;
                }
            }
        }
        System.out.println("Upper triangular matrix");
    }
}
