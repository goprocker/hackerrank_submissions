# Strings - Analyzing Sentence Complexity in Content Writing

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Imagine you are developing a content evaluation tool for writers. The tool assesses the readability and complexity of the text they create, providing a "difficulty quotient" to help gauge whether the content is suitable for a target audience. Words that are considered "hard" might indicate a higher complexity level, while "easy" words suggest a more readable passage. You are tasked with implementing the algorithm that calculates this difficulty quotient based on predefined rules.

You are given a string containing multiple words separated by spaces. A word is considered "hard" if:

- The number of consonants is greater than the number of vowels.
- There are three or more consecutive consonants in the word.

Otherwise, the word is considered "easy." Implement a function to count the number of hard and easy words in the string and calculate the difficulty quotient using the formula:

Difficulty quotient = (5  *hard) - (2*  easy)

Return 0 if the input string is null.

 **Input Format** 

- A single string str containing multiple words separated by spaces.
- The string contains only lowercase English letters and spaces.

 **Constraints** 

- The output value lies within the integral range.
- The input string may contain only lowercase alphabets and spaces.
- If the string is null or empty, the output should be 0.

 **Output Format** 

An integer representing the difficulty quotient.

 **Sample Input 0** 

```
qlewldoaa life ace by fantasy

```

 **Sample Output 0** 

```
11

```

 **Explanation 0** 

- qlewldoaa: Hard (more consonants than vowels)
- life: Easy
- ace: Easy
- by: Hard (3 consecutive consonants)
- fantasy: Hard (more consonants than vowels)

Calculating Difficulty Quotient:

Difficulty quotient = (5  *3) - (2*  2) = 15 - 4 = 11

 **Sample Input 1** 

```
openai is awesome

```

 **Sample Output 1** 

```
-6

```

 **Explanation 1** 

- openai: Easy
- is: Easy
- awesome: Easy

Calculating Difficulty Quotient:

Difficulty quotient = (5  *0) - (2*  3) = 0 - 6 = -6

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    BufferedReader br=new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
    String s=br.readLine();
    if(s==null||s.trim().isEmpty()){System.out.println(0);return;}
    int hard=0,easy=0;
    for(String w:s.trim().split("\\s+")){
      int v=0,c=0,run=0; boolean three=false;
      for(char ch:w.toCharArray()){
        if("aeiou".indexOf(ch)>=0){v++;run=0;} else {c++;run++;if(run>=3)three=true;}
      }
      if(c>v||three)hard++; else easy++;
    }
    System.out.println(5*hard-2*easy);
  }
}

```
