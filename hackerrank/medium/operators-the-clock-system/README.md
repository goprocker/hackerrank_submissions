## Problem

Your friend has problem a reading the time if a clock follows 24-hour format so you decide to help him out. You have two integers X and Y. Your task is to find and return an integer value representing the product of these two integer in the 12-hour system.

 **Input Format** 

- An integer value X
- An integer value Y

 **Constraints** 

NA

 **Output Format** 

Return an integer value representing the product of the two integers in the 12 hour system.

 **Sample Input 0** 

```
4
5

```

 **Sample Output 0** 

```
8

```

 **Explanation 0** 

Here, X = 4 and Y= 5 and their product is 4*5=20. Therefore, 8 is returned as the output in 12-hour system.

 **Sample Input 1** 

```
2
5

```

 **Sample Output 1** 

```
10

        int X = scanner.nextInt(); 
        int Y = scanner.nextInt(); 
    
        int product = X * Y; 
        
        int ans = product % 12;
        if (ans == 0) {
            ans = 12;
        }
        
        System.out.println(ans); 
        
        scanner.close(); 
    } 
}
