## Problem

You are developing a small application for a fitness app. In the app, users usually enter their workout duration in N minutes. Your task is to convert the minutes and return an integer representing the equivalent value in seconds.

 **Input Format** 

An integer value N representing the workout in minutes.

 **Constraints** 

NA

 **Output Format** 

Return an integer representing the equivalent value of N in seconds.

 **Sample Input 0** 

```
5

```

 **Sample Output 0** 

```
300

```

 **Explanation 0** 

Here, N = 5. The conversion of 5 minutes will be 5 x 60 = 300 seconds. Hence, 300 is returned as output

 **Sample Input 1** 

```
3

```

 **Sample Output 1** 

```
180

```

 **Explanation 1** 

Here, N = 3. The conversion of 3minutes will be 3 x 60 = 300 seconds. Hence, 180 is returned as output.
