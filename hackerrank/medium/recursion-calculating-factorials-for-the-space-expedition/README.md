# Recursion - Calculating Factorials for the Space Expedition

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

In the futuristic world of 2140, a team of astronauts is preparing for a journey to Mars. As part of their training, they are required to calculate various mathematical functions, one of which is the factorial of a number. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

To streamline their calculations, the team decided to implement a program that uses recursion to compute the factorial. Your task is to help them write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a recursive approach.

Write a program that takes a non-negative integer as input and returns its factorial using recursion.

 **Input Format** 

The input consists of a single non-negative integer n.

 **Constraints** 

NA

 **Output Format** 

Print the factorial of the number.

 **Sample Input 0** 

```
5

```

 **Sample Output 0** 

```
120

```

 **Explanation 0** 

The factorial of 5 is calculated as:

5!=5×4×3×2×1=120

 **Sample Input 1** 

```
0

```

 **Sample Output 1** 

```
1

```

 **Explanation 1** 

The factorial of 0 is defined as:

0!=1

public class Solution {
    static long factorial(int n) { return n <= 1 ? 1 : n * factorial(n - 1); }
    public static void main(String[] args) { Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in); int n=sc.nextInt(); System.out.print(factorial(n)); }
}

```
